- Synchronous
- Single Thread

- execute one line of code at a time
- ***Each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing***


## Blocking Code vs Non-blocking Code

### Blocking Code
- Block the flow of program
- Read file sync

### Non-Blocking Code
- Doesn't block the execution
- Read file async

## Event Loop
